<br><br><p>The COVID-19 has resulted in schools shut all across the world. Globally, over 1.2 billion children are out of the classroom.</p>
<p>As a result, education has changed dramatically, with the distinctive rise of e-learning, whereby teaching is undertaken remotely and on digital platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Here are the Top 5 Reasons Why Colleges should be Re-Opened</strong></p>
<h3 id=there-is-lack-of-face-to-face-communication>There is lack of face-to-face communication</h3>
<p>The lack of face-to-face communication combines many of the shortcomings of online learning described above. The lack of face-to-face communication with teachers hinders student feedback, leads to social isolation, and can reduce student pressure. Stress is a disadvantage because it makes it easier for students to drop out. For many people, regular contact with teachers may be unwelcome, but it is an effective way to retain students.</p>
<h3 id=online-learning-causes-social-isolation>Online Learning causes social Isolation</h3>
<p>The online teaching methods used in education often experience, distance, and lack of interaction among participating students, which will cause many students and teachers who inevitably spend most of their time online to experience signs of social isolation. Because of the lack of interpersonal communication in their lives. Social isolation and lack of communication often lead to various psychological problems, such as increased stress, anxiety and negative thoughts.</p>
<h3 id=online-learning-requires-strong-self-motivation-and-time-management-skills>Online Learning requires strong self-motivation and time management skills</h3>
<p>The lack of self-motivation of students is still one of the main reasons why students do not take online courses. In traditional classrooms, there are many factors that continuously drive students toward their learning goals. Work together so that students will not be distracted while studying.</p>
<p>However, in the online learning environment, there are fewer external factors that drive students to perform well. Even if they are not constantly moving towards their learning goals in their learning activities, students participating in online learning courses find that they often need to learn complex materials in a comfortable home environment without the extra pressure that traditional universities usually require. Therefore, online learning is difficult to complete on time. It is difficult for students who lack strong self-motivation and time management skills.</p>
<h3 id=lack-of-communication-skills>Lack of Communication skills</h3>
<p>Facts have proved that e-learning methods are very effective in improving students’ academic knowledge; however, cultivating students’ communication skills is an area that is often overlooked in online teaching. In an online environment, students may find that they cannot work effectively in a team environment. The neglect of students' communication skills inevitably leads to many graduates who have excellent theoretical knowledge, but they are unable to impart their knowledge to others.</p>
<h3 id=online-education-is-limited-to-theory-there-is-no-practical-knowledge>Online education is limited to theory, there is no practical knowledge</h3>
<p>Although this drawback of online Learning is starting to be addressed and fixed by some of the more innovative online learning platforms, the problem has yet to disappear completely. The problem is that a large portion of E-Learning training providers choose to focus largely (in many cases entirely) on developing theoretical knowledge, rather than practical skills. The reason for this is evident – theoretical lectures are considerably easier to implement in an online learning environment than practical lectures. After all, without face-to-face communication and physical classrooms to use as a workshop, implementing practical projects in an online course requires significantly more prior planning than theoretical training.</p>
